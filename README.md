# EMNIST_Supervised

The EMNIST (Extended Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) Letters Dataset is an extension of the well-known MNIST dataset, which is the bread and butter of machine learning benchmarking. What sets EMNIST apart is its larger size and, as the name suggests, its inclusion of handwritten letters. This project will focus on the letter component within this extended dataset.

Image processing often relies on deep learning, which is CPU and GPU intensive. Through Supervised Learning, this project will show how we can create robust Classification models for handwritten letters. These models are more efficient and can be used on everyday machines, which would make them more accessible and useful for a broader audience.
